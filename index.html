      <h2>Björk Guðmundsdóttir</h2>
      <p>
        Björk has spent four-decades moulding pop music in her own image, a
        unique visionary who creates alien worlds through her music, inviting us
        all in to explore them with her. Her work exists at the intersection
        between music, art, technology, science and mathematics, creating a
        unique world. <br />

        Björk’s creative impact spreads far beyond music alone. She’s shared
        ideas about ecology with Sir David Attenborough and changed fashion with
        her collaborations with Alexander McQueen. The ecologist and philosopher
        Tim Morton described her as someone who has had “a very deep influence
        on [his] way of thinking and life in general,” while her chameleonic
        approach to visual identity over the decades continues to inspire
        filmmakers to this day. <br />

        The visionary and singular artist will be headlining bluedot festival
        2020, a UK festival exclusive taking place at the Jodrell Bank
        Observatory from 23-26 July. Here, we look at how Björk influenced not
        only modern music, but the way we live.

      <h2>Biophilia</h2>
      <p>
        Her 2011 album ‘Biophilia’, named after the notion that humans are
        inherently attracted to nature, was accompanied by ten mobile apps – one
        for each of the album’s ten singles, the first time this was ever done.
        Each app was created by a global team of designers, all tasked with
        somehow transporting the inner-workings of Björk’s imagination into a
        6-inch phone screen. <br />

        Through a series of interactive apps that are part-music video,
        part-instrument, her aim was to teach users how sound and nature are
        inherently connected. In essence, you don’t simply listen to tracks like
        ‘Dark Matter’ or ‘Moon’ through your headphones, you play them for
        yourself. <br />

      <h2>Crystalline</h2>
      <p>
        The app for ‘Crystalline’ is distilled into scrolling sheet notes and
        lyrics, where users can isolate different melodies and play them on home
        instruments. The ‘Virus’ app takes the form of a microscopic world of
        human cells, where the user must stop an illness taking over by the song
        by frantically flicking their fingers across the screen. Imagine a
        predecessor to Candy Crush, and you’re almost there. <br />

        When the project was launched in 2013, it was described as “a new type
        of musical theory” by Wired Magazine, one that is freely available to a
        global audience at the tap of a glass screen. “The whole theme was about
        connecting the dots, building bridges between things that didn’t have a
        bridge before,” she told the magazine. “Nature and technology, atoms and
        the galaxy. It is so overreaching in unifying everything in the
        Universe.”

      <h2>Vulnicura</h2>
      <p>
        Since Biophilia, as technology has evolved into AI and virtual reality,
        so has Björk. In 2019 she released Vulnicura VR, a five-year quest to
        transport fans into the real and surreal world of Björk. Viewers travel
        to the blackened plains of Iceland on ‘Stonemilker’, a bioluminescent
        garden (where Björk quite literally dances amidst destruction) on
        ‘Notget’, and on the Jesse Kanda directed ‘Mouth Mantra’, an entire
        six-minute video shot within Björk’s mouth.

      <h2>While there is truly only one Björk</h2>
      <p>
        We can at least model ourselves in her image. In 2016, as part of the
        Björk Digital exhibition in Tokyo, Björk debuted Rottlace, a 3-D printed
        acrylic masked based on scans of the underlying musculature of her face.
        For the project, Björk teamed up with Neri Oxman, head of MIT Media
        Lab’s Mediated Matter research group, a team made up of computational
        designers, architects, marine scientists and molecular biologists.
        <br />
        Over the years, Björk has further experimented with the idea of making
        her face open-source for anyone to wear, which has stretched beyond a
        literal mask. In December 2019, Björk teamed up with her longtime
        creative collaborator James Merry to produce an Instagram filter of her
        medusa mask, seen in the video for Vulnicura single ‘Notget’. The filter
        contorts the human face into a fluorescent green unearthly image through
        a front facing camera screen.

      <h2>Björk’s World of Natural Wonder</h2>
      <p>
        Björk’s list of past collaborators is as long as they are diverse.
        Madonna, fashion designer Alexander McQueen, archaic pop producer Arca
        and Antony (of ‘and the Johnsons’ fame) have all worked with Björk over
        her long career. But perhaps her most unlikely collaboration comes with
        a 93-year old, softly spoken national treasure: Sir David Attenborough.
        <br />

        In the 2013 Tilda Swinton narrated documentary When Björk Met
        Attenborough, the two devoted conservationists discussed everything from
        the ferocity of volcanoes and the mathematical basis of crystals, to
        their shared love of the Lyrebird. On the surface, Attenborough and
        Björk may seem like an opposing duo. After all, one is an experimental
        musician who once performed in what was described as a ‘vagina dress’,
        the other has devoted his near-century long life to earth’s
        preservation. <br />

        But, owing to her Icelandic upbringing, Björk has long admired the
        British broadcaster’s passion for the natural world. “There is such a
        big chunk of me that is David Attenborough. I think he is my biggest
        inspiration,” she said in an interview with The Times in 2001. The
        feeling is mutual. On ‘Oskasteinn’, the opening track of 2014’s
        Biophilia Live, Attenborough can be heard introducing the performance –
        “With Biophilia comes a restless curiosity, an urge to investigate the
        elusive places we meet nature,” he says in his unmistakable voice. “But
        much of nature is hidden from us, that we can neither see or touch. Like
        the one phenomenon that can be said to move us more than any other in
        our daily lives: sound.” <br />

        More recently, Björk continues to raise her (otherworldly) to campaign
        against climate change. In a November 2019 London performance, Björk
        included a message from environmental campaigner Greta Thunberg. “We
        have to speak clearly, no matter how uncomfortable that may be,” says
        Thunberg. “But imagine what we could all do together if we wanted to.”
